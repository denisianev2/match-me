# matching_algorithm
### author of original files: Denis Ianev and Mehmet Tokmak
This purpose of the project was to create an algorithm that would uniquely match mentors and mentees with one another. The mentees and mentors were matched with one another based on various critieria, such as their preferences, interests, region/time zone, field of work, etc.

After the mentees and mentors had been matched with one another, a Webex space was automatically created for each pair.

The requirements.txt file contains all the necessary libraries for this project.

The files logged here and their purpose are as follows:
## Matching algorithm related:

db: stores the functions to read in the initial data files 

jaccard: primary code file for matching the mentors and mentees.

## Webex space automation related:
webex: code to create all rooms in which the Webex bot exists by calling a room creation from the frontend
